Hello.<br>
Welcome to Kinko.<br>
A tool for sharing your kinks and roleplaying preferences.<br><br>
Kinko is designed to offer an easy way to specify your likes, dislikes and requirements for ERP. <br>Currently it can only output a HTML file. This can be either opened, copied and embedded on any website that allows JavaScript, or shared as a web-page via messaging services such as Discord. Although for security reasons it’s recommended you only open HTML files from people you trust. <br><br>
In the future, Kinko might expand into something more. With ways of comparing kinks with other people. For the time being it’s just a novel tool for those who have a use for it.
